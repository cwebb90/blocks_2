﻿//this should help for later down the line when we want to switch between different states.
//its not necessary for right now, but would be nice to get a working project going.

//im pretty sure that this is some type of object ive not come across before.
//we only create references to it? its like it exists mainly here and you can just call it by itself
//instead of creating an actual ScenesManagerObject.
//i need to research it more but if it works how i think that it works, its really really cool
